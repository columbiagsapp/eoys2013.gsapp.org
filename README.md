#End of Year Show 2013

For the End of Year Show 2013, the Architecture Online Lab installed 10 IP cameras around the school and built a website to stream the installation setup, vernissage, slow decay and teardown at a frame rate of one image per minute. Users could scroll backwards in time to animate the page, effectively creating an interactive timelapse.

Following the exhibition, the stills were converted into videos, which are now on the site.

##Feeds Page

Users can navigate sequentially through the feeds from the main view, or see each of the feeds simultaneously from the master view and select which feed to enter in full screen.
